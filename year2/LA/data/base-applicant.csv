"Town of Many","1085016","5400000","48","8","4575","The majority of the Town of Many water supply comes from its surface water treatment plant which takes raw water from the Hurricane Creek outfall into Toledo Bend. Because of its location in the creek outfall, the turbidity of the water spikes after rain events, and manganese levels as high as 1.7 mg/L have been recorded. The intake does not have thecapability of varying the elevation that water is taken from, so droughts and low lake level are also problematic. To improve the quality of source water, construction of a new intake is proposed where Bayou La Nana connects to the lake, preferably close to the river channel so as to provide the most flexibility for depth of water. A new raw water pumping station will be built, and water will be pumped through a new raw water transmission main from the intake/pumping station to the current treatment plant. The new transmission piping will also allow for the existing asbestos cement transmission main to be abandoned.te surface water intake.","September-24"
