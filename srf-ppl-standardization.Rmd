## Introduction

This notebook transforms raw data scraped from state PPLs and IUPs and provides a single, harmonized output. 

Details for necessary transformations, crucial context, and discussion on decisions and assumptions can be found in each state's Background Information PDFs, available as a data download through the SRF Dashboard.


Process Overview

The overall process flow for each state is:
1. clean names
2. remove rows and columns that don't include project data
3. process numeric columns
4. process text columns
5. add state name
6. standardize column names
7. keep only cleaned and standardized column names

Once this process is done for each state, the cleaned dataframes are combined and formatted as input for `dw-dashboard-data-cleaner.R`
which prepares the data for external presentation in the SRF Dashboard.


Outline code

Within this documents outline, parenthetical codes denote where in process each state is:
- None: Not currently in need of updates
- A: Applicant data needs to be added
- ADD: Add to Data Dictionary, awaiting adding documentation page
- DD: Added to Data Dictionary, awaiting review from policy team
- NS: Not Started
- Q: Question currently blocking progress, awaiting resolution from policy team
- WIP: Work in progress

New Columns:
- Does not have `requested_amount`, but does have `estimated_project_cost` that could be included
- EC mentions `requested_amount` but it is used for funding amount
- Applicant data treats `estimated_requested_project_costs` as project_costs to be consistent with the funded project data

## Ohio (Q in DD)

- From the IUP, it looks like 35-Ohio_PPL_Base includes all projects and the other tables simply add data
- what should we call `estimated_loan_amount` considering we are treating this like Applicant data because clearly they are not all going to get funded? is it `project_cost`? Shouldn't be `funding_amount` if we are keeping that for only fundable projects
- what should be done with `estimated_principal_forgiveness`? Similar questions as above, but also note that three of the six projects are listed as BYPASS, meaning that would need to be dropped for it to be a numeric column and we'd lose half of the values from that table

## Rhode Island (WIP)

- Applicant data is processed, but not ready to add
- Mentions `requested_amount` or `project_cost`
- No mention of *Interest Rates or Loan Terms*

the comprehensive list provides data on each borrower such as population and PWSID
as well as project descriptions and scores for each project, even where there are multiple projects for the same borrower

the funding list, on the other hand, is only at the borrower level and only includes
the loan amount, the borrower's name (which often does not match the comprehensive list),
and has been manually updated to include project_type based on which table the projects were listed
the one:many relationship in the comprehensive list and the different units of analysis creates a
degree of uncertainty in which projects are funded or not.

Easy example: City of Newport is listed as receiving one loan for Lead and 
have only one Lead project which matches between the requested amount and the loan amount

More Difficult example: Providence Water is receiving two loans. 25M for Lead and 21M for General.
While they only have one Lead project, it is for $184M.
They have 3 General projects with different Project Descriptions that are all requesting more than $25M,
so it is not clear which project is being funded and which data should be included in the dashboard.
