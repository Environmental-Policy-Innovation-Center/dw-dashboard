redundant storage capability to allow the existing 2MGD clearwell to be removed from service
for maintenance or for emergency repairs. The additional clearwell will improve disinfection
contact time and permit a wider operating range for clear well storage capacity and disinfection
dosage rates.  The proposed improvements should increase filter run time and provide a more
