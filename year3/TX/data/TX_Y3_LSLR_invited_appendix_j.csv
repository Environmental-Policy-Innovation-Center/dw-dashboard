Therefore, the maintenance and upkeep of the District�s assets is critical to ensure quality and reliable service to its constituents. The proposed project is comprised of two phases which includes the 1) lead service line inventory and replacement plan, and 2) lead service line replacement. The inventory and replacement plan will identify and include both the public and private sides of the water service lines. Additionally, the inventory and replacement plans will identify possible changes to Lead and Copper sampling within the system, water system reporting, public education requirements, and the introduction of a new lead trigger level. Further details on the requirements of the lead service line replacement, including environmental impact analysis, will be identified at a later date. Once more information is available, we can then provide additional details into the planning and scoping for the lead service line replacement. For purposes of this PIF, we used best judgement practices to estimate the costs associated with the lead service line replacement. The District is in the process of completing the lead service line inventory. As of today, the District has confirmed 223 service lines do not contain lead material based on available historical data and record drawings. The remaining 499 service lines were constructed prior to 1988 (most date back to the early 1970s) and the material is currently listed as unknown.
