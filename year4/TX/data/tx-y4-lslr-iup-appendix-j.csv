The proposed project is to conduct the field inventory of each household connection, document and classify the service line inventory in accordance with TCEQ. The inventory method used includes evaluation of materials, review of construction records and plumbing codes, review of water and distribution system records, and review normal operations.",Inventory,500000
2,46.86,Vernon,17143,TX2440001,9788,Lead Service Line Inventory and Replacement,The City of Vernon completed an initial inventory based on home construction date records. The City is now requesting funds to take a more detailed inventory of unknown service lines and replace existing service lines as required.,"Inventory, Replacement",11000000
3,42.49,Texarkana,17146,TX0190004,39800,Inventory of Select Service Lines,"This funding request is for the inventory of service lines in two specific areas within Texarkana, TX. These two areas have been identified as two areas of concern. The first area is Downtown Area of Texarkana. This area is undergoing renewal and revitalization and contains some of the oldest water service lines in the City. The area is challenging to assess the water service line material due to most of the service lines being under concrete or asphalt, with meter boxes in the sidewalks. We are proposing to use the ElectroScan Swordfish device to determine material type thus avoiding the disruption that would be caused by excavation. The Downtown area has 240 connections that will require inspection. The second area is the Beverly Area Subdivision. A mixture of Electro Scan Swordfish and excavation of service lines when under grass. There are 1016 connections requiring inspection in this neighborhood.","Inventory, Replacement",787000

The City developed this inventory based on records review and a small set of field inspections. This inventory identifies 9,188 lines that are of unknown material. This proposed project is for the exploration and identification of lead-status for those 9,188 water service line connections of unknown material.",Inventory,748750
5,39.08,Angleton,17147,TX0200002,27333,"Lead and Copper Rule Monitoring Plan Phase 2, 3,
and 4","Phase 2: Based on POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION, develop a budget, identify and secure funding for completion of removal and replacement. A public outreach plan will be developed and implemented to assist in the removal and replacement of lead or galvanized pipe previously connected to lead service lines on private property.
Phase 3: Refining the work performed in Phase 1 and Phase 2. More invasive measures will be implemented to investigate the UNKNOWN category. This phase will be iterative and will follow the same location identification, budget development, funding, removal/replacement and public outreach process developed as part of Phase 2.
Phase 4: A Monitoring Plan will be developed and will require continued outreach to work with the public and other agencies for lines that remain to be determined. This plan could continue invasive efforts for identifying pipe materials. The plan will be updated. The Monitoring Plan will include all necessary reporting and testing per published guidance.","Inventory, Replacement",11491173
6,37.06,Laredo,17149,TX2400001,255949,Lead Service Line Inventory and Replacement,"The City of Laredo is undertaking a comprehensive project to identify and replace service lines throughout the City to protect public health and comply with environmental standards. Through initial GIS surveying, the City identified approximately 37,615 unknown service lines that require further assessment for potential replacement. The first phase of this project will involve refining preliminary survey data through detailed field assessments and data verification to accurately identify pipe materials of these unknown lines. These efforts are expected to reduce the number of unknown lines, ensuring a more precise and targeted line replacement process. Any surplus of funds from the inventory process will be allocated to begin replacing critical lead service lines in high priority areas while also working towards a citywide replacement.","Inventory, Replacement",43064898.1

There was not sufficient enough data to classify the material at the time. These services need to be field inspected to confirm their material. Services found with galvanized, or lead material will be replaced with new plastic service lines.",Inventory,2250000
