All existing water meters shall be replaced with new meters. Multiple contracts shall be required to install distribution system improvements. Mains shall be upgraded and dead ends shall be looped through this project. Targeted mains shall be determined through an extensive hydraulic model of the system's distribution system. The proposed project will allow Southwest Ouachita Waterworks, Inc. to reduce the consumption versus production loss to less than 10%. The current losses exceed 25%. Losses are attributable to the worn, inefficient water meters within the distribution system. The new metering system shall increase system revenue and reduce operation expenses. When identified, brass containing lead shall be replaced through this project. Distribution system improvements shall eliminate leaking mains and loop dead ends. Looping of mains shall improve circulation, reducing DBPs and stabilizing chlorine residuals. Areas of high demand shall also be targeted for main upgrades. Multiple areas experience severe pressure fluctuations due to lengthy, small diameter mains. These mains shall be replaced with larger mains and looped when feasible. 30 Year Loan Term",BIL-GS,CLOSED,Yes,Yes,NO,NO,BIL-GS,D
