The project is in response to two Notices of Violation within the last 12 months for Total Haloacetic Acid (HAA5) concentration violations. The City has struggled with elevated total organic carbon (TOCs) concentrations in the source water arising from the karst geology of the area. Since all water currently must travel from the City's only water plant located on the extreme north side of the city, water on the South side has a high water age, allowing TOC to develop into HA5 and other disinfection by products. Although the City has made major progress in combating disinfection byproducts through an ozone treatment system at the existing water plant, it continues to experience violations. The solution proposed to eliminate HAA5 violations is to reduce the system water age through connecting dead-end lines on the south side of the City, utilizing a new and closer water source (New WTP 2) and providing a connection from this proposed looped system into the downtown area.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the dam was originally designed and constructed as a Class A, or low-hazard dam. The State of Georgia's Safe Dams Program has classified the dam now as a Category I, or high-hazard structure. The Barber Creek Reservoir is located just south of Highway 316, and according to the City of Statham's Source Water Assessment Plan (SWAP) of 2002, the reservoir contains approximately 42 acres and has a watershed area of 5.5 square miles. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) considers this to be a small drinking water supply watershed, and the reservoir is fed by Barber Creek. The City of Statham 's ""Barber Creek Drinking Water Reservoir Rehabilitation Project"" consists of dredging the City's 42- acre raw water reservoir to restore the City's main drinking water supply source, and to upgrade the City's water treatment facility so it will be capable of pre-treating the water intake. Since the reservoir's construction in 1959, the capacity of the reservoir has been reduced by 60 percent due to siltation rendering the body of water. In addition to the reservoir's shallow depth, the silt build-up has significantly caused taste and odor issues and the large number of customer complaints has forced the City of Statham to temporarily cease the operations of it's water treatment facility. The dredging and sediment removal of approximately 55,000 units will restore the City of Statham 's water supply asset and provide adequate drinking water for the 5,535 residents of Statham and the surrounding community. By means of dredging and sediment removal, bacteria would grow at a significantly lesser rate and create less of a burden on the City's water customers who currently deal with odor and taste issues. In order to make the Barber Creek Reservoir a once-again viable source of drinking water, the City of Statham will be required to dredge the reservoir and make upgrades to the water treatment facility to allow for pre-treatment of the raw water coming into the treatment facility. The City of Statham is currently purchasing water from two adjacent systems, however, this method is both temporary and extremely limited due to their own shortage of water supply. The City of Statham has a large investment in their water treatment facility, which is capable of treating up to one million gallons of water per day (1 M GPD), but the degraded raw water quality has made it nearly impossible to treat water at all."

Current supplier, Kendall Supply, has noted for several years now that the meters are failing, and our legacy transmitters are also outdated. Current transmitters are not able to perform AMI-based readings, which means that we must send an employee out on the field to perform meter reads. With an AMI-based system, staff will have constant communication with the meters rather than having to send an employee to read them out on the field every time a reading is necessary. ****The One-Step QBS process has been ongoing and will be completed at the November 14th City Commission meeting****"

Despite CCWA and its contractors adding over 50 miles of waterlines of various sizes to its distribution in the past ten years, many residents in Carroll County remain without a safe and reliable potable water source. In addition, a water model of CCWA’s distribution system indicates that adding water mains along select roadways could be hydraulically beneficial, resulting in a more robust water distribution system with lower pumping costs and fewer dead end pipelines. The proposed construction project will consist primarily of installing waterlines along roadways in unincorporated Carroll County to expand potable drinking water service and improve system hydraulics."

The Authority had to use its emergency connection to the City of Zebulon to maintain adequate supply and pressure during the repair period. This failure along with continued growth of the past few years requires the Authority to look for additional water sources. This project includes the construction of a new deep well water supply, chemical feed building and treatment system for anticipated iron/ manganese contaminants. In December of 2018, the Pike Water & Sewer Authority submitted a request to the state for a well withdrawal permit. At the time of submission, the Authority(County) had 230 customers. As of the time of this application the Authority serves 400 customers and has plans to serve an additional 373 customers plus a future Subdivision near GA Hwy 362 and the future School Complex near Concord.
