The proposed project iscomprised of two phases which includes the 1) leadservice line inventory and replacement plan, and 2) leadservice line replacement. The inventory and replacementplan will identify and include both the public and privatesides of the water service lines. Additionally, the inventoryand replacement plans will identify possible changes toLead and Copper sampling within the system, watersystem reporting, public education requirements, and theintroduction of a new lead trigger level. Further details onthe requirements of the lead service line replacement,including environmental impact analysis, will be identifiedat a later date. Once more information is available, we canthen provide additional details into the planning andscoping for the lead service line replacement. Forpurposes of this PIF, we used best judgement practices toestimate the costs associated with the lead service linereplacement. The District is in the process of completingthe lead service line inventory. As of today, the District hasconfirmed 223 service lines do not contain lead materialbased on available historical data and record drawings.The remaining 499 service lines were constructed prior to1988 (most date back to the early 1970s) and the materialis currently listed as unknown.
