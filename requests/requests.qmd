The purpose of this document is to memorialize data analyses requests. The objective is to clarify the request and to maintain a log of who did what, when, and why.

To include a new request, follow this template using the shortcode `request` with positional arguments {TAG}{DATE}{SOURCE} {REQUESTED_BY} {SUMMARY} {RESOLUTION}. The {SUMMARY} and {RESOLUTION} arguments can handle lists[^1].
:::

[^1]: See initial request source code.
