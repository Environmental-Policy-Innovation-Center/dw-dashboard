MUNICIPAL WATER AUTH. OF ALIQUIPPA- LEAD SERVICE LINE REPL.,160 HOPEWELL AVENUE,ALIQUIPPA,BEAVER," This project includes the replacement of 184 existing lead water service lines from the main line to property line (curb box) with 3/4"" copper water service lines. To determine the material type of the service lines the contractor excavated roughly 250 sites via vacuum truck for visual inspection of the service lines. Of these 250 sites, 170 have been identified as having lead service lines, while the remaining were either copper or unable to be accessed. An additional 14 sites are suspected as lead service lines due to the identified buffalo style curb boxes, which have had a history of containing lead service lines. This brings the total project scope to 184 properties known or strongly suspected of having lead service lines. In regards to the private side of the service lines, it is assumed that roughly 10% of the total sites will have lead, or 18 private side service lines to be replaced. MWAA is committed to replacing the private side of the service lateral. Based on historic experience and a limited field verification in January/February 2021, a value of 10% of the service lines that contain lead on the public side will also contain lead on the private side. Confirmation on the private side will be conducted via excavation during construction. Construction includes service line replacement including corporation at the main, curb box, and connection to existing just outside of structure wall, trench restoration, curb, sidewalk, walkway, lawn, and roadway restoration, and all appurtenances required for complete construction. "," The purpose of this project is to remove existing lead service lines in the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (MWAA) service area to improve the overall water quality and reduce the health risk that is present due to the aging lines. Lead in drinking water can cause brain and kidney damage, and interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of the body. The greatest risk of lead exposure is to infants, young children and pregnant women. Studies have shown that the effects of lead on the brain correlate with lowered IQ in children. The Lead and Copper Rule was established to protect public health by minimizing lead and copper levels in drinking water, primarily by making water less corrosive. When the water is corrosive, the lead and copper found in plumbing materials can leach into drinking water. Pennsylvania’s Lead and Copper Rule establishes an action level of 0.015 mg/L for lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper. MWAA is required to conduct sampling every 6 months. An action level exceedance occurs if the results from more than 10% of the homes tested are above the action level. For the monitoring period of January 1 to June 30, 2020 MWAA had 32 samples collected and tested for lead. The 90th percentile value for lead was 0.0421 mg/L, exceeding the 0.015 mg/L action limit by almost three times. Due to these results MWAA has been required to do additional parameter monitoring, corrosion control treatment, source water monitoring/treatment, and public education. In addition to these requirements, the removal of lead lines in the system has become a priority.",91,V,5040006,APPLICATION PENDING,-,1,"$1,867,000",DS/LSL,"14,250",No,N/A,116,N/A,$0

Removal and replacement of the service lines is desired and considered necessary in order to ensure continued compliance with the Department’s Lead and Copper Rule, Title 25 Chapter 109, Subchapter K. The improvements will enhance Bethlehem’s ability to operate and maintain the system and increase the reliability of service. "," The City of Bethlehem-Water and Sewer Resources (Bethlehem) distribution system contains a significant number of residential (with some commercial) service laterals constructed in the 1920s and the 1930s which are primarily comprised of lead. Bethlehem proposes the replacement of approximately 250 primarily residential (and a small number of commercial) 5/8-inch diameter existing service lines (and ¾-inch diameter galvanized steel pipe with lead goosenecks service lines) for an estimated average total of approximately 12,500 feet (LF) of piping with assumed lead materials primarily in areas in the City of Bethlehem, Northampton County. These service lines are older sections of the City of Bethlehem’s service area with and without recent water main replacements and based on their experience are assumed to be comprised of lead. The proposed project will include all necessary water line appurtenances associated with the service line replacements such as valves, shut-offs, water main construction, manways, test digs, repair to damaged facilities during construction, etc. found necessary during the service line replacement and installation.

PATTON MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY - MAGEE AVENUE WATERLINE REPL.,P.O. BOX 175,PATTON,CAMBRIA," The project will replace approximately 700 linear feet of 8"" cast iron pipe with new 8"" C900 PVC main line, as well as approximately 600 linear feet of service line. Associated valves and restoration will be included in the project. "," The original Patton water distribution system was constructed over 100 years ago and consists of cast iron pipe with lead joints. These lead components represent a health risk to the community. Additionally, the age of the line to be replaced means that the Authority is correcting leaks and breaks at a much higher rate than elsewhere in the system. Since implementation of the new well water source in 2016, this portion of the system has experienced increased customer complaints relating to water quality, particularly discolored, sediment-heavy, and smelly water.",35,V,4110024,APPLICATION PENDING,-,24,"$600,000",DSL/LSL,"2,290",No,N/A,50,N/A,$0
