7,50,Bridge City,TX1810001,"9,500","The purpose of this project is to provide a new nanofiltration system to remove organiccarbon from the raw water before chlorination. The project will also provide new piping,concrete foundations, filter cover, ground storage tank, pumping, controls, andmodifications necessary to bring the Romero Water Well back into production. RomeroWater Well was abondoned due to high levels of trihalomethanes (THM) in theirfinished drinking water. THM is considered a disinfection by product that results fromchlorinating raw water high in organic carbons.",PDC,"$4,792,450.00"
8,40,Laredo,TX2400001,"256,153","Source Water Monitoring along the Rio Grande for Preventative Water Treatment Plantnotification of contaminants.

9,40,Corpus Christi,TX1780003,"318,168","It has been proposed to add a third treatment train to the existing treatment facility toprovide redundancy, and to improve treatment methods that can ensure compliancewith the upcoming EPA proposed National Primary Drinking Water regulations on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Preliminary analysis will be conducted withbench scale and pilot testing to determine the most efficient and effective method ofPFAS removal for the source water utilized to serve over 500,000 residents. Followingthe pilot study, design and construction of a full-scale treatment system thatencompasses PFAS removal will be completed.",P,"$1,875,000.00"

11,40,"Canyon RegionalWater Authority",,"267,352","CRWA will be performing bench scale and pilot testing for PFAS removal at their LakeDunlap Water Treatment Plant (LDWTP). This testing will be included in the plannedOzone feasibility study project. The testing will include two treatment technologies. Thefirst technology will use the existing Nano filtration to remove PFAS and use Surface-Active Foam Fractionation (SAFF) for PFAS concentrated waste stream. The secondtechnology will use existing advanced treatment with Ozone by adding ferric oxide andpersulfate as a catalyst to remove PFAS from drinking water. However, the use of ferricoxide and persulfate with ozone will be evaluated carefully as this process will dependon the PFAS compounds present, pH of water, and other specific chemicalcharacteristics of the water. This improvement will prepare CRWA for future PFASregulation. The study will ensure that the CRWA is equipped to meet the newregulations and provide safe drinking water to its customers.",P,"$2,187,000.00"
12,40,Arlington,TX2200001,"394,266","The proposed project includes the source water monitoring, bench and pilot-scaletesting, and conceptual design for PFAS treatment to address a known occurrence ofPFAS compounds present in the City of Arlington’s source water. The City intends tohire a third-party to develop a testing plan, and operate and maintain a pilot-scale plantusing the existing pilot plant at its John F. Kubala Water Treatment Plant (JK WTP) tostudy the feasibility of using a GAC treatment strategy for PFAS removal.

13,40,Fort Worth,TX2200012,"1,381,310","Understanding PFAS levels in each source and whether there are seasonal variations iscritical as the utility undertakes pilot testing of various PFAS removal technologies. Theutility intends to conduct pilot testing of powdered activated carbon, granular activatedcarbon, and ion exchange treatment technologies (with a focus on carbon adsorption).Based on pilot testing results, a site-specific conceptual treatment scheme and life-cyclecosts for each of the five drinking water treatment plants would be developed. Theconceptual designs and cost estimates would be incorporated into the utility's five-yearCapital Improvement Plan and later moved into construction for regulatory compliancewith the proposed rule implementation schedule.",P,"$1,040,000.00"
