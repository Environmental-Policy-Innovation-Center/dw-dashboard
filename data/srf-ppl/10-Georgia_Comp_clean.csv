This tank replacement  project is necessary due to the  deteriorating condition of the existing  tank and the rapid expansion of the  hospital which is outgrowing the capacity  the current tank can provide.  Since  Wellstar Kennestone Hospital is a Level II  Trauma Center and houses the largest  and busiest Emergency Department in  Georgia, the hospital serves residents in  the region of Cobb, Cherokee and  Paulding counties, a population of over  1.2 million people.  The goal of the Sugar  Hill Water Tank project is to improve the  drinking water supply and fire protection  needs not only for the citizens of  Marietta, but of the many Georgians that  utilize the Wellstar Kennestone Hospital  for their healthcare needs."
