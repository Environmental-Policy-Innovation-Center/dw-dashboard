Therefore, the maintenance and upkeep of theDistrict’s assets is critical to ensure quality and reliableservice to its constituents. The proposed project iscomprised of two phases which includes the 1) lead serviceline inventory and replacement plan, and 2) lead service linereplacement. The inventory and replacement plan willidentify and include both the public and private sides of thewater service lines. Additionally, the inventory andreplacement plans will identify possible changes to Leadand Copper sampling within the system, water systemreporting, public education requirements, and theintroduction of a new lead trigger level. Further details onthe requirements of the lead service line replacement,including environmental impact analysis, will be identified ata later date. Once more information is available, we canthen provide additional details into the planning and scopingfor the lead service line replacement. For purposes of thisPIF, we used best judgement practices to estimate thecosts associated with the lead service line replacement. TheDistrict is in the process of completing the lead service lineinventory. As of today, the District has confirmed 223service lines do not contain lead material based on availablehistorical data and record drawings. The remaining 499service lines were constructed prior to 1988 (most dateback to the early 1970s) and the material is currently listedas unknown. The District is preparing to perform fieldverification inspections soon to identify the material of the499 service lines.",PDC,"$2,715,000.00"
