SERVICE LINE REPL. PHASE II",160 HOPEWELL AVENUE,DS,ALIQUIPPA,1,DWSRF,10/20/21,V,"The scope of this project includes the replacement of an estimated 275 existing lead water service lines, determined from soft dig #3 
and soft dig #4 contracts, from the main line to property line (curb box) with 3/4"" copper water service lines. To determine the material 
type of the service lines a contractor has been contracted to excavate roughly 90 sites from soft dig #3 and 590 sites from soft dig #4 
via vacuum truck for visual inspection of the service lines. The replacements will occur in the City of Aliquippa. MWAA is committed to 
replacing the private side of the service lateral. For the private side of the service lines, it is assumed that roughly 10% of the total 
sites are lead, or 28 private side service lines to be replaced.  Based on historic experience and a limited field verification, a value of 
10% of the service lines that contain lead on the public side will also contain lead on the private side.  Confirmation on the private side 
will be conducted via excavation during replacement of the public side service. Construction proposes service line replacement 
including corporation at the main, curb box, and connection to existing just outside of structure wall, trench restoration, curb, sidewalk, 
walkway, lawn, and roadway restoration, and all appurtenances required for complete construction.
PROB. DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this project is to remove existing lead service lines in the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (MWAA) service 
area to improve the overall water quality and potentially reduce the health risk that is present due to the aging lines. Lead in 
drinking water can cause brain and kidney damage, and interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all 
parts of the body. The greatest risk of lead exposure is to infants, young children and pregnant women. Studies have shown that 
the effects of lead on the brain correlate with lowered IQ in children. The Lead and Copper Rule was established to protect public 
health by minimizing lead and copper levels in drinking water, primarily by making water less corrosive. When the water is 
corrosive, the lead and copper found in plumbing materials can leach into drinking water. In addition to these requirements, the 
removal of lead lines in the system has become a priority and system will replace lead service line to reduce lead from the water 
supply.","The purpose of this project is to remove existing lead service lines in the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (MWAA) service

includes the installation/replacement of approximately 34,000 lineal feet of new distribution system piping and all necessary 
appurtenances (12-inch, 8-inch and 6-inch valves, shut-offs, hydrants (53), blow-offs, service laterals, etc.). Work will include 
transferring/replacing services from existing mains of various sizes to the new water main. Interconnections within the system will also 
be made between existing pipe mains at various locations to improve system pressure and fire protection capabilities. Work also 
includes a new tie in and pressure regulating station at the existing HCA Highland Finished Water Storage Tank to replace an older 
PRV station as well as a new pressure regulating station near Oakmont Road to serve the Ebervale.  The improvements will enhance 
HCA's ability to operate and maintain their existing PWS facilities.

5 million gallons per day (MGD) pumps with variable frequency drives (VFDs) as well as constructing a new parallel 24-inch 
transmission/intake pipe from the Roan Reservoir to the WTP junction chamber are proposed to remedy the demand situation. To 
improve monitoring and control abilities, HCA proposes upgrading the SCADA system and filter/clarifier consoles, as the existing 
facilities are in poor condition and in need of repair and rehabilitation due to components no longer functioning effectively and some 
components being obsolete. HCA proposes to convert the existing chlorine dioxide system to include automatic controls and

flocculation operation and reduce chemical usage.  Lastly, HCA has identified safety issues with existing access to the caustic bulk 
storage tank and electrical safety issues with the existing blower motor.  HCA proposes to install custom steps, railing, and a platform
