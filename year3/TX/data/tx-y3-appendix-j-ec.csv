The Entity hasperformed testing on its drinking water sources and hasdetected the presence of several PFAS substances. This projectwill be to provide a new drinking water source via City ofGoldthwaite’s (TX1670001) water system. This project willconsist of the construction of approximately 43,000 linear feet ofa supply line, valves, boring, and all associated incidentals. Thesupply line will route to the Entity’s existing GST. In addition tothe supply line, this project includes replacing the Entity’spressure tank, high-service pumps (2), electrical improvements,and chemical feed improvements to return the Entity’s system toTCEQ compliance. This project will also include improvementsto the City of Goldthwaite’s distribution facilities to supplydrinking water to New Horizons.

SWSC’s WTP #1 is rated to treat 6 MGD, while WTP#2 and #3 are both rated to treat 8 MGD each (total of 22 MGD)of surface water diverted from the Rio Grande River. The waterfrom the Rio Grande River is conveyed to SWSC’s facilities viaa series of open channel irrigation canals. The Rio Grande Riveris an impaired waterbody from a water quality standpoint andthe existing raw water delivery system to the treatment facilitiesfacilitates the further degradation of water quality prior totreatment. Recent sampling revealed the presence of severalemerging contaminants in SWSC’s water, including PFOS,PFOA, and PFHxS. The intent of this project is to equip SWSC’sexisting plants with additional treatment capabilities to removethe identified emerging contaminants.
