1,255,"New HorizonsRanch andCenter, Inc.",TX1670009,100,"The Entity currently owns and operates a water treatment facility that utilizesfree chlorine to treat raw water from Meadows Lake which sources its waterfrom the Pecan Bayou. The Entity has performed testing on its drinking watersources and has detected the presence of several PFAS substances. Thisproject will be to provide a new drinking water source via City of Goldthwaite’s(TX1670001) water system. This project will consist of the construction ofapproximately 43,000 linear feet of a supply line, valves, boring, and allassociated incidentals. The supply line will route to the Entity’s existing GST. Inaddition to the supply line, this project includes replacing the Entity’s pressuretank, high-service pumps (2), electrical improvements, and chemical feedimprovements to return the Entity’s system to TCEQ compliance. This projectwill also include improvements to the City of Goldthwaite’s distribution facilitiesto supply drinking water to New Horizons. The Entity qualifies for very smallsystem principal forgiveness funding and also submitted a SFY2026 PIFthrough the regular DWSRF program for this project.",PDC,PFAS,"$     3,004,025.00"
2,235,Sharyland WSC,TX1080033,"97,990","Sharyland Water Supply Corporation (SWSC) owns and operates three watertreatment plants, WTP #1, WTP #2, and WTP #3. SWSC’s WTP #1 is rated totreat 6 MGD, while WTP #2 and #3 are both rated to treat 8 MGD each (total of22 MGD) of surface water diverted from the Rio Grande River. The water fromthe Rio Grande River is conveyed to SWSC’s facilities via a series of openchannel irrigation canals. The Rio Grande River is an impaired waterbody froma water quality standpoint and the existing raw water delivery system to thetreatment facilities facilitates the further degradation of water quality prior totreatment. Recent sampling revealed the presence of several emergingcontaminants in SWSC’s water, including PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS. Theintent of this project is to equip SWSC’s existing plants with additionaltreatment capabilities to remove the identified emerging contaminants.Specifically, this project will include the design and construction of newGranular Activated Carbon (GAC) treatment systems for removal of thesecontaminants.",PDC,"PFOS, PFOA,PFHxS","$   40,900,000.00"
3,232,Manville WSC,TX2270033,"91,023","MWSC is a non-profit water supply corporation and was selected formonitoring as part of the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule(UCMR 5). UCMR 5 results showed elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkylsubstances (PFAS) and lithium The proposed project would include theplanning, design, and construction of treatment and associated infrastructuresized to remediate and remove PFAS from the13 active drinking water wellsand two (2) additional future wells.",PDC,"PFAS, Lithium","$   38,940,000.00"
