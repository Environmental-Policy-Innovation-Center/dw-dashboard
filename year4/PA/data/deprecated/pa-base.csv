This project also includes construction of a 300,000-gal finished water storage tank and a 500-gpm booster pump station to deliver water from the new facility. The Buck Run water treatment facility will treat water from the existing Buck Run and Zimm wells, and will be submitted to PENNVEST as a separate project.","The Mercersburg Water Authority (Authority) owns the Buck Run filter plant which treats surface water from the Buck Run Reservoir. The existing reservoir and filter plant are in need of major rehabilitation or replacement as evidenced by numerous violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act which were recorded in a Notice of Violation (NOV) dated February 26, 2020. The Authority entered into a Consent Order and Agreement (COA) with the Department on September 10, 2020. This COA required the Authority to prepare an Existing Facilities and Treatment Alternative Study which outlined methods for compliance, the costs of those methods, and the Authority’s plan for achieving compliance. The Study concluded that the lowest cost, feasible compliance alternative was the development of a new groundwater source and the construction of two new water treatment facilities: the Park Avenue water treatment facility and the Buck Run water treatment facility. This alternative will allow the Authority to abandon the Buck Run Reservoir and existing filter plant.","2,350",88,No,N/A,N/A,$0
