The station was originally constructed in the 1970’s and is past its useful life, having received minimal improvements since that time. It is also not equipped with a permanent emergency generator. The station does not currently meet state or local codes. Therefore, the facility needs a major upgrade including electrical components, chemical feed system, pumping, controls, and emergency power.
