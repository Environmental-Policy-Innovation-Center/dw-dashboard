This notebook transforms the project-level data that powers the SRF Funding Tracker into state-level aggregate data and store it in AWS.

The generated features include status columns for each column in the project-level data - whether it is Complete, Partial, or Missing, as well as summarized statistics for the count of projects, the type of project, whether the applicants are state-defined DACs, and whether they are expecting funding or not. Percentages and other statistics are then generated from these results. See the full data dictionary [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdFCCTpw3GKs9-kmNnRkm7tjK-yktozTeO3fA9ejuPg/edit?usp=sharing).

The resulting dataset can answer a number of high-level questions for each state in a given state fiscal year, like "what percentage of DACs are expecting funding?" or the inverse - "how many projects expecting funding are supporting DACs?". The dataset is used extensively in `year-over-year.Rmd` to create the data visualizations used in the SRF Funding Tracker state landing pages.
