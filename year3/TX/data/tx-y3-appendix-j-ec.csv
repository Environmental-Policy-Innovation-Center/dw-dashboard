4,235,"East Rio HondoWSC",TX0310096,"36,117","East Rio Hondo Water Supply Corporation (ERHWSC) owns and operates the MarthaAnn Simpson Water Treatment Plant (MASWTP).  MASWTP is rated to treat 8 MGD ofsurface water diverted from the Rio Grande River and conveyed to the facility via a seriesof open channel resacas and canals. It is well-known that the Rio Grande River is animpaired waterbody from a water quality standpoint and the existing raw water deliverysystem to ERHWSC’s treatment facilities facilitates the further degradation of waterquality prior to treatment.  Recent sampling revealed the presence of two emergingcontaminants in ERHWSC’s raw water; PFOS and lithium.  The intent of this project is toequip the MASWTP with additional treatment capabilities to remove the currentlyidentified emerging contaminants as well as those that may be present in the future.Secondary/future goals for this project include implementing brackish groundwater at theMASWTP for both blending and alternative water supply purposes. The conceptualdesign for this project includes a new, 8 MGD reverse osmosis treatment system forremoval of both PFOS and lithium.  The current conceptual design utilizes brackishgroundwater for blending to achieve downstream concentration goals.  Future ratios ofpotential blending and implementation of additional brackish groundwater will becontingent on future raw surface water contaminant concentrations and disposal permitlimitations.  Additional improvements include pretreatment filtration and posttreatmentsystems, clean-in-place system, electrical, mechanical, and piping improvements, aninjection well for concentrate disposal, two brackish groundwater wells, backupgenerators, and new building.",PDC,"$53,526,415.00"

6,235,"Johnson CountySUD",TX1260018,"65,427","The Johnson County Special Utility District (District) is proposing a new ReverseOsmosis Water Treatment Plant (RO WTP). The District has historically relied on acombination of groundwater and surface water supplies. However, with the rapidlydeclining capacity and quality of local shallow, freshwater groundwater aquifers due tooverdevelopment of the groundwater supply by residential and commercial developersover the past 30 years, current and future water demands will need to rely on surfacewater supplies and/or deeper, brackish groundwater supplies. Additionally, the area isseeing rapid growth and needs additional drinking water. An asset management plan willalso be included as part of the project. The proposed project includes the use of reverseosmosis (RO) technology to prepare for upcoming PFAS limits initiated by EPA. Giventhe verification of the presence of emerging contaminants like PFAS in the source waterfor this facility (Lake Granbury), JCSUD is implementing RO technology to be prepared toreduce emerging contaminants from its source water.",PDC,"$205,315,000.00"

The proposed project includes construction of a granularactivated carbon (GAC) gravity contactor process facility, inclusive of the necessarysupporting infrastructure modifications and ancillary facilities, to remove the confirmedPFAS compounds.
