City of Calhoun,"17,088","$7,000,000",24,02/30/2024,3/30/24,3/30/2025,"There are a total of four (4) pressure filter trains at Brittany Drive. Each vessel includes a clarifier and three filter cells. The media volume for each train is slightly larger but comparable to the volume of a gravity filter mentioned above. We anticipate replacing the anthracite media in each vessel with the same Filtrasorb 820 granular activated carbon. We estimated the cost for each train from the May 23, 2022 quote. We increased the estimated cost due to the filter volume being slightly larger (935 cuft. vs 832 cuft.), and the labor to remove the existing media should be greater in the pressure vessels than the gravity filters. The same applies to the pressure vessels that once a filter have been converted to GAC, the GAC will need to be changed out once PFAS break‚Äêthru begins. We would expect the change out cost to be similar to the conversion cost quoted. This cost does not include the option for an RO plant, this only includes an initial study for the existing MGD plant."
City of Chatsworth,"4,247","$25,000,000",27,5/31/2024,6/30/24,10/30/2026,"Chatsworth Water Works Commission currently supplies water from the Eton Spring, Oneal Spring, Carters Lake, and Nix Spring. To continue to meet demand, the City of Chatsworth plans to construct a Reverse-Osmosis Treatment Plant at either Eton Spring, Carters Lake, or Lake Conasaga to supply water to its population. The final cost will depend on the engineering study for which site provides the optimal solution and if additional easements will be needed."
