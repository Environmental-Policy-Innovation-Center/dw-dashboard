"Creston Water System, Inc.",1069003,1310000,43,6,660,1310000,"The purpose of the proposed project is to construct improvements to the Creston Water System, Inc. to resolve ongoing deficiencies. The project includes select distribution system replacement, ground storage tank, booster station, electrical & control upgrades, iron/manganese treatment system, generators, site work, site piping and related work. The system's raw water wells contain high levels of iron and manganese. Iron and manganese levels exceed the secondary maximum containment levels as established by the EPA. Accordingly, this project is proposed under the BIL Emerging Containments program of DWRLF",November-22
