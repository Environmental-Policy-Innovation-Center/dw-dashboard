City of Opelousas,1097010,10500000,50,3,16500,"The purpose of the proposed project is to upgrade the existing 3 MGD WTP to treat high levels of iron and manganese. The system's raw water wells contain high levels of iron and manganese. Iron and manganese levels exceed the secondary maximum containment levels as established by the EPA. Accordingly, this project is proposed under the Emerging Containments program of DWRLF",September-24
Town of Many,1085016,5400000,48,5,4575,"The majority of the Town of Many water supply comes from its surface water treatment plant which takes raw water from the Hurricane Creek outfall into Toledo Bend. Because of its location in the creek outfall, the turbidity of the water spikes after rain events, and manganese levels as high as 1.7 mg/L have been recorded. The intake does not have thecapability of varying the elevation that water is taken from, so droughts and low lake level are also problematic. To improve the quality of source water, construction of a new intake is proposed where Bayou La Nana connects to the lake, preferably close to the river channel so as to provide the most flexibility for depth of water. A new raw water pumping station will be built, and water will be pumped through a new raw water transmission main from the intake/pumping station to the current treatment plant. The new transmission piping will also allow for the existing asbestos cement transmission main to be abandoned.te surface water intake.",January-24
"Creston Water System, Inc.",1069003,1310000,43,6,660,"The purpose of the proposed project is to construct improvements to the Creston Water System, Inc. to resolve ongoing deficiencies. The project includes select distribution system replacement, ground storage tank, booster station, electrical & control upgrades, iron/manganese treatment system, generators, site work, site piping and related work. The system's raw water wells contain high levels of iron and manganese. Iron and manganese levels exceed the secondary maximum containment levels as established by the EPA. Accordingly, this project is proposed under the BIL Emerging Containments program of DWRLF",November-22

City of Lake Charles-Center East WTP,1019029,1430000,21,27,85000,Center East WTP Filter Replacement: Proposed project will include removal and replacement of an existing pressure filter that has failed. The filter was used to removal of iron and manganese. The project is submitting for Emerging Contaminant funding from BIL to address manganese treatment.,January-23
City of Carencro,1055005,6600000,16,36,10485,"The proposed project will include the construction and installation of approximately 4,600 linear feet of water line and two water wells to supply water to Hector Connoly Water Treatment plant from 105 E Musique Road along Rue Coupe Civique and Hector Conly Road. The system's raw water wells contain high levels of iron and manganese. Iron and manganese levels exceed the secondary maximum containment levels as established by the EPA. Accordingly, this project is proposed under the Emerging Containments program of DWRLF",March-26
