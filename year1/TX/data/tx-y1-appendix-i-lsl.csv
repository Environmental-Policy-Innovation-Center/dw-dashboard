inventory and review of the data WU will be able to fully document the number of lead service lines within the water service area in Texas. With the information provided by the service line inventory TWU will then develop a plan to replace all water service lines containing lead, contaminated by lead, or suspected of being contaminated. TWU plan is to use a non-excavating inspection process to identify connections from the water main to the water meter and from the water meter to the point beginning of the customer service line for
locations that were either installed prior to July 1, 1988, or that the actual installation date could not be verified as being prior to July 1, 1988. With this information a plan will be developed to replace all portions of the service line requiring replacement to
