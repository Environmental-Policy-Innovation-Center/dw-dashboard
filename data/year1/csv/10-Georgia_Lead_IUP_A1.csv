We need a full inventory and data collection (i.e. researching date of building construction), then we need outreach to the affected homeowners and business owners and coordinate visual inspections looking for soldered connections. Then we are going to have to make replacements. We are an older city, and in fact our city was the site of the very first U.S. gold rush (prior to California). Our historical downtown is on the Historic Register and we have many of the original buildings. Since those buildings date to the 1800s, most of them will be needing to be remediated but carefully so as not to disturb the original cobblestone walks. This will be a big undertaking. Also many of the residential homes are quite old and were originally built with lead lines. And some are built well off the roadway since we are a truly rural community. In addition to the inventory and visual inspections we estimate that approximately 1,250 or more buildings will wind up having lead pipes which we will then have to replace.

The County wishes to be considered for the grant opportunity and has only selected the loan opportunity as a back-up option. In addition, the County is requesting low-interest loan financing in the amount of $3,000,000 for a Lead Service Line Replacement project. 1) Lead Service Line Inventory Project: The County has started developing a service line inventory in accordance with the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule Revisions and most recent guidance. Currently, the County is upgrading its entire system with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) water meters by June 2024. Wherever possible, the County’s AMI contractor is documenting service line materials during meter installation on both the public (water system-owned) and private (customer-owned) sides. Based upon a desktop analysis, the County has identified less than 10,000 water service connections installed before 1990. At this time, the AMI contractor has inspected more than 1,000 of these locations. Based on the data collected so far, the County anticipates service line materials at 6,000 locations will need to identified by other means, such as customer self-reporting, water testing using targeted, flushed, or sequen(cid:415)al sampling protocols, and/or predic(cid:415)ve modeling. 2) Lead Service Line Replacement Project: The County assumes 10% of water service connections installed before 1990 (approximately 1,000 locations) will have lead or galvanized steel service lines requiring replacement."

A constant (multiplier) of 3.0 used in the Selig Center’s Economic Study was applied to the vehicle counts at the entry gate, resulting in an estimated total of 3.6 million visitors for the year 2017. The target population for stakeholder involvement throughout this project would be the entire resident, visitor, and business pool on Jekyll Island, as they all use water and sewer resources during their stay or activities on the island. This project aims to address the critical issue of lead water lines on Jekyll Island by providing funding to replace lead and galvanized water service lines with safe and sustainable alternatives. The expected outcome will result in enhanced sustainability and resilience of water infrastructure through the use of modern and durable materials. Funding of the replacement of the Jekyll Island lead service lines will support the transition to safer and more reliable water infrastructure, ensuring that all residents and guests have access to safe and clean drinking water. The Jekyll Island State Park Authority is requesting $700,000.00 in funding to replace all lead and galvanized service lines, goosenecks, and adaptors. The resources will be used to benefit the entire target area of Jekyll Island, Georgia, ZIP code 31527. All work will be completed and submitted to EPD no later than October 16, 2024."
