The improvements will enhance HCA's ability to operate and maintain their existing PWS facilities.","The Hazleton City Authority (HCA) owns and operates a public water supply (PWS) system (PWS ID No. 2408001) which serves the residents and commercial establishments in and around Hazle Township, Luzerne County. Based on a recent Feasibility Study conducted by HCA to provide adequate supply and pressure to existing and proposed customers on the western side of HCA’s distribution system, a booster pumping station with all necessary appurtenances is proposed. It is to be located near the intersection of S.R. 424 and 309 in Hazle Township, Luzerne County. The new booster station will enable HCA to adequately operate and maintain the PWS system and provide adequate system pressure and supply to its existing and proposed customers.","38,022",63,No,N/A,N/A,$0

Each source will be treated at the Authority’s existing Fort Loudoun membrane filtration plant. Development of these additional sources will provide a combined additional source capacity of up to 1.56 million gallon per day (MGD). This will ensure that the system has sufficient source capacity to reliably and consistently meet demands, which will result in increased protection of public health and safety.","The Authority’s existing sources include six (6) other wells, a surface water withdrawal from Broad Run, and a finished water interconnect with the Borough of Chambersburg. The surface water source is not reliable during summer/fall due to low flows. Additionally, the interconnect with Chambersburg is not available if Chambersburg needs the water for their own uses. Therefore, the system’s total reliable source production capacity is 1.0 million gallon per day (MGD). The system’s 2020 average daily use was 1.22 MGD and the peak daily use was 2.05 MGD. The system’s reliable source capacity does not meet the average and peak demands.","12,000",43,No,N/A,N/A,$0

Neighborhoods are selected based on a prioritization formula developed by PWSA in consultation with our Community Lead Response Advisory Committee (CLRAC). On a census track basis, the formula considers 1) the number of children under 6 years of age and women of child bearing age, 2) blood lead level data from ACHD, 3) the number of lead and unknown service lines in our inventory and 4) income level. Once the prioritization model is run for the PWSA water service area, neighborhoods are selected from our Level 5 and 4 Priority levels. Our 2023A Neighborhood LSLR project selected Priority 5 Neighborhoods, starting with the neighborhoods with the lowest income. For this project, neighborhoods within an Environmental Justice Area (as defined by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) are further prioritized, and Level 4 neighborhoods were selected, ranking them by income. Based on this prioritization model run, PWSA estimates that the project will work at around 1,200 homes and replace 680 public and 570 private lead service lines.","PWSA implemented efforts to replace public lead service lines in 2017 and expanded to private lead service lines starting in early 2018. While great strides have been made in both corrosion control treatment (CCT) and Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR), much work remains. As critical as CCT is to water quality, the issue of lead in drinking water will not be resolved until all lead service lines are removed from the system. PWSA’s goal, only impacted by available funds to complete the work, is to remove all lead service lines by 2026. Existing lead service line contribute to lead, MCL exceedance in the service area. Project goal is to eliminate/reduce lead level from the water supply.","370,000",,No,N/A,N/A,$0

The estimation of private side service lines requiring replacement is based on GIS data available to date and LCA field staff experience and are located in older sections of the Allentown Division’s service area. There are 150 potential lead service lines within the project area to allow for service line replacement. The service line replacements are located primarily along North Penn Street, West Washington Street, West Cedar Street, Park Street and North 9th Street in northern end of the City of Allentown, Lehigh County. The proposed project will include all necessary water line appurtenances associated with the service line replacements such as valves, curb stops, shut-offs, water main construction, test pits, manways, etc. found necessary during the service line replacement and installation. The existing service laterals identified as part of this project are older and comprised primarily of lead and/or galvanized. Removal and replacement of the service lines is desired and considered necessary to ensure continued compliance with the Department’s Lead and Copper Rule, Title 25 Chapter 109, Subchapter K. Improvements will enhance LCA’s ability to operate and maintain the system and increase the reliability of service.","In order to ensure continuous compliance with the Department's Lead and Copper Rule (Title 25 Chapter 109 Subchapter K), the Lehigh County Authority (LCA) has undertaken the identification of lead service lines found within older sections of their distribution system constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. To identify these service lines and determine the project scope, LCA’s GIS mapping of their water distribution system, which includes its public and private water service lines, was utilized. LCA is currently in the process of further developing the information in their service line inventory in accordance with EPA’s Guidance for Developing and Maintaining a Service Line Inventory as well as PADEP’s similar guidance. Resources used so far in the development of the inventory include information obtained from field staff through meter replacement program; City of Allentown 1955 Ordinance requiring all City portion of service lines to be either cast iron, brass, or copper; year dwellings constructed (post 1986 considered non-lead); and work-order information. This service line inventory data was then overlapped with environmental justice areas within the City and the resulting mapping reviewed during workshop calls to discuss constructability, prioritization, size of project, and proximity of replacement areas to identify the final 2023 replacement project area. The existing service laterals identified as part of this project are older and comprised primarily of lead and/or galvanized. As a result of the investigations, LCA – Allentown Division proposes the LCA Allentown Lead Service Line Replacement 2023 Project which includes the replacement of approximately 149 private and 1 public lead and/or galvanized service lines in the City of Allentown, Lehigh County.

EWW is hereby proposing to replace or abandon (for those services which are inactive) approximately 850 total services within the City of Erie over a period of two to three years. Where the customer side of the service line is galvanized / wrought iron, the customer side will also be replaced up to the location of where the service line enters the structure.","EWW is planning to address lead-related threats to public health in drinking water. As of the time of this application, EWW has approximately 6,000 wrought iron service connections within its distribution system, the vast majority of which are located in the City of Erie. Upon completion of EWW’s current funded WIFTA and Phase Two projects, there will be approximately 2,700 remaining wrought iron services in the distribution system. These wrought iron service connections are connected to the water main by a lead gooseneck between the corporation stop and the curb stop on the utility owned or public side. The customer owned or private side of the service line associated with wrought iron on the utility side is often also galvanized / wrought iron with threaded joints and not lead. Although EWW maintains an effective corrosion control program and has maintained compliance with the lead and copper rule, the presence of these lead goosenecks within the system nonetheless represents a potential threat to public health. Therefore, permanently removing the lead goosenecks from the system will help to alleviate this threat.","190,000",,No,N/A,N/A,$0
